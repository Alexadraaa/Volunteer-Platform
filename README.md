Cooperative System for Disaster Relief Registration and Assistance

This project aims to develop a cooperative system for registering requests for assistance and servicing needs in a community affected by a natural disaster. The system allows citizens to declare their specific needs for various items or to state that they have surplus items available for donation.
Rescuers, operating in designated vehicles, facilitate the pickup and delivery of items between citizens and a central warehouse acting as a base.

Features:

  1.  User Registration: Citizens can register accounts using their mobile phones.
  2.  Request Assistance: Citizens can declare their needs for various items such as water, food, medicine, etc.
  3.  Donation: Citizens can declare surplus items available for donation.
  4.  Mission Management: Rescuers can view all requests and offers on a map interface and undertake one or more missions for item pickup or delivery.
  5.  Central Warehouse: The base serves as a central warehouse for storing and distributing items.
  6.  Announcements: The base can announce needs for items that are in short supply, displayed on citizens' mobile phones.
  7.  Item Declaration: Citizens can declare whether they have items requested by the base for pickup by rescuers.
